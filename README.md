Learning all the languages that are being spoken around the world is not an easy task. It is a
difficult task for a tourist to communicate or to understand the foreign languages when he
migrates from one region to another region and he can’t easily adapt to that transmission. The
main idea of our project “NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSOR” is to process one
language to another language . It receives the audio or speech of the object spoken in one
language as the input, processes it with the help of modules, generates the text for the given
audio in that language and gives an audio that is translated to another language as output. The
output of the module would be with higher accuracy and precision. Built-in python libraries
and modules like gTTS, playsound. NLP plays a vital role in our project.
